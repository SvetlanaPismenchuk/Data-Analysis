# Data-Analysis
This Python program reads tree data from a CSV file, calculates the average tree height, and determines how much each tree’s height deviates from the average. The results are then written to a new CSV file with an added deviation column.

# How
The program reads a CSV file containing tree ID, latitude, longitude, and height.
It stores each column into separate lists.
It computes the average tree height.
It calculates the deviation of each tree’s height from the average.
It writes the original data plus deviations into a new CSV file.
